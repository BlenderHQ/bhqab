Wrapped Text Rendering
=======================================================

Text block rendering is tested manually. The main purpose of the test is that
individual lines of text should not be interrupted or shortened by the Blender
User Interface.

The main criteria are the following:

* The text block is displayed in full

* No lines ending or separated by dots
